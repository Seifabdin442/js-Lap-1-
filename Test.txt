Tags: A tag is a reference to a specific commit, typically used to mark a version or a release point. There are two types of tags in Git 
      1)Lightweight Tags: These are simply pointers to a specific commit. They do not have any additional metadata and are quick to create.
      2)Annotated Tags: These tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. They can include additional information such as the tagger's name, email, date, and a tagging message.

Release: is a higher-level concept often associated with Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. A release typically involves a tag and includes additional metadata and binary files associated with the release. Creating a release on these platforms provides a convenient way to package and distribute software.
